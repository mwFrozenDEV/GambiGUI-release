## **History**  
GAMBIGUI's journey began with a simple problem:  
- I had two graphics configurations, one for RP and one for RP, and wanted to switch between them quickly.  
- To solve this, I created a basic **batch file** to handle the swap.  

But why stop there?  
- I expanded the functionality to allow creating custom graphics configurations, leading to the birth of [**Gambify**](https://github.com/mwFrozenDEV/redm-gambify).  
- While Gambify was a good start, it was basic and prone to bugs.  

Enter **GambiGUI**:  
- With a robust architecture built in C# and an intuitive WinForms interface, GambiGUI evolved into a comprehensive tool for RedM PvP.  
- It aims to become a complete **PvP hub** for RedM, simplifying not just graphics management but all aspects of competitive play.  

**Enjoy!**
